## Victorinox

- In good times, Victorinox built up reserves of cash, knowing that at some point there would be more difficult times. 
- As CEO Carl Elsener says, “When you look at the history of world economics, it was always like this. Always! And in the future, it will always be like this.
- It will never go only up. It will never go only down. It will go up and down and up and down. . . . We do not think in quarters,” he says. “We think in generations.”
- This kind of infinite thinking put Victorinox in a position where they were both philosophically and financially ready to face what for another company might have been a fatal crisis. And the result was astonishing. Victorinox is now a different and even stronger company than it was before September 11. Knives used to account for 95 percent of the company’s total sales (Swiss Army knives alone accounted for 80 percent).
- Today, Swiss Army knives account for only 35 percent of total revenue, but sales of travel gear, watches and fragrances have helped Victorinox nearly double its revenues compared to the days before September 11.
- Victorinox is not a stable company, it is a resilient one. The benefits of playing with an infinite mindset are clear and multifaceted. So what happens when we play with a finite mindset in the Infinite Game of business?

- It is a growing business—and we want to be in business for a good long time.
- The test of our sincerity (or our hypocrisy) will be if everything we sell is useful, multifunctional where possible, long-lasting, beautiful but not in thrall to fashion. We’re not yet entirely there.
